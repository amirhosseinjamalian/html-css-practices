# 🧩 Mini Projects

This folder contains my small HTML & CSS practice projects.

Each folder here represents a mini project I’ve created while learning frontend development — simple exercises to improve my layout, animation, and design skills.

### 📁 List of mini projects
- **Switcher** — theme or color switcher using CSS and JavaScript.
- **Login Pages** — different login page designs with animations.
- **Pars Pack Clone** — a small landing page inspired by Pars Pack website.
